# Visualizing trading data in R  

This tutorial explains how to import high-frequency trading data and visualize it using the Plotly library


## Library import  
Import the necessary libraries that you intend to use for your project.  
There are packages that allow real-time trading data import which could come handy for algo trading.  
I have used the following packages for my codethrough.  

library(plotly) # Graphs  

library(xts) # Time-series constructor  

library(tidyverse) #Ease of use

```{r global, include=FALSE}

# library(shinythemes)
library(plotly) #Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools
library(xts) #Constructor function for creating an extensible time-series
library(tidyverse) # Used for faster and easier data analysis

```


## Data import  
I have used the Metatrader application to download USDEUR Forex trade data as a csv file.  
Many websites provide us with trade data in various formats.  
CSV would be suited for use in our case. I have downloaded the EURUSD forex trade data from Metarader application.

You can find the application in the following link.

https://download.mql5.com/cdn/web/metaquotes.software.corp/mt5/mt5setup.exe?utm_source=www.metatrader4.com&utm_campaign=download

I have uploaded the file onto my Github account for ease of access.

```{r Data import }
# Importing trading data from the csv file downloaded from Metatrade ----

library (readr)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkarthi6/CPP526_Kavin/master/EURUSDM1.csv",
                header = FALSE, sep = ",", fileEncoding = "UTF-16LE", dec = ".")

head(data)

```


## Data cleaning  
Data that is available online would not always meet our requirements.  
We will need to make a few changes to the way data is stored and make sure it is suited for the type of analysis that we intend to carry out.  


```{r Data cleaning }

# Renaming the columns using the column name vector

colnames_ <- c("Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Tick", "Volume")
colnames(data) <- colnames_
head(data)

# Formatting the date to standard form YYYY-MM-DD

data$Date <- gsub("\\.", "-", data$Date)
data$Date <- as.POSIXct(data$Date)
head(data)

```


## Data visualization
The plotly package is used here for visualization.  
Since trading data requires special plotting methods, we have used plotly.  
The last 20 minutes of data alone is included in our visualization to improve graph readability.


```{r Data visualization}

# Using plotly to visualize the last 20 min of trading data

fig <- tail(data, 20) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~Date, type = "candlestick",
          open = ~Open, close = ~Close,
          high = ~High, low = ~Low)
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = "USDEUR trading data ")
fig

```
